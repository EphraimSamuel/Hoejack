## Who is Hoejack?

Hi, my name is Sam but I go by the name Hoejack which is just scrambling the name of my beloved tv character Bojack Horseman. This is my first time trying to pen down my thoughts on a blog I was inspired by a fellow developer after I came across her blog shout out¬†@[Edidiong Asikpo (Didi)](@didicodes) ¬†for inspiring this lost soul, Well back to the story I am a 22-year-old Artificial intelligence engineer from Nigeria, I recently got certified by IBM after completing their professional certification on Coursera¬†*Hold the applause this is where it gets weird.*

### Why am I starting a blog?

Here it Goes let's embrace the weirdness üòÇ. After completing my certification I decided to do some research and engage with others in my field, during these interactions I discovered I was severely underequipped .. please note: This is not a result of my teachers that taught me or the curriculum the IBM certification was taught I was the only one to be blamed because looking back on how I approached the certification I approached it as more of an exam than a learning experience, so basically I studied only to pass my weekly assessments and build my projects to be submitted before the deadline, due to this attitude I ended up missing out greatly and now I have the certificate but I'm lacking in key areas concerning knowledge, these gaps go so deep sometimes I find myself not being able to recall or apply concepts which I have learned.... well to cut the long story short, I suck as an artificial intelligence engineer but is that gonna get me down? NO!! We move forward.

### What Next?

I have resolved to re-learning anything and everything I learned while taking the IBM course I also stumbled upon kaggles teaching material and that shall be my starting point, I also commit to learning and posting updates daily on what I have learned and projects I might be working on. I'm doing this to hold myself accountable and also as a great way to document my journey from "Regular Hoejack" to "Hoejack The Creator"

Wish You All Peace and Love as you follow me on this journey and May God and The Ancestors Be with You üòÅ
